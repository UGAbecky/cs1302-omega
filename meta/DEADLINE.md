## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the app
> category that you chose, and the primary functions available to users
> of the app.

I chose to program the classic arcade game, pong. Pong's primary functions are to invoke
a fun tennis-like arcade game that consists of a ball being bounced back and forth two players.
As the round continues, the ball's speed increases which creates more of a challenge for the users.
The primary functions available to users is through mouse event handlers. In order to start the game you
need to stroke the mouse, and in order to control the user's paddle, you can control it with the mouse.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I thought it was exciting that I was able to create one of my childhood games. From our cumulative
knowledge of javafx, event handling, and other topics throughout this semester, this project was really enjoyable.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

I might want to create a more advanced version of pong. The original version is great but simple. I could
create different versions of the game or event create a more concise way to code this game.
